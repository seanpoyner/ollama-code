# AI-Powered Task Planning Fix

## Problem
Task planning was using hardcoded templates based on simple keyword matching (e.g., if request contains "web" and "gui", use web GUI template). This resulted in generic, non-specific tasks that didn't actually address the user's request.

## Solution
Created an AI-powered task planner that analyzes the user's specific request and creates appropriate tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. New AITaskPlanner Module
**File:** `ollama_code/core/ai_task_planner.py`

- Uses the Ollama model to analyze requests and create task plans
- Sends a structured prompt asking the AI to create specific, actionable tasks
- Parses the AI response to extract tasks with priorities
- Includes fallback handling if AI fails

**Key features:**
- Tasks are specific to the actual request
- Priorities assigned intelligently (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Includes technical implementation details in task names
- Extracts explanation from AI for better context

### 2. Updated ThoughtLoop
**File:** `ollama_code/core/thought_loop.py`

- Added AITaskPlanner integration
- Accepts model name in constructor
- Uses AI planner for task decomposition instead of hardcoded templates
- Maintains fallback for reliability

### 3. Updated Agent
**File:** `ollama_code/core/agent.py`

- Passes model name to ThoughtLoop constructor
- Enables AI-powered task planning

## Example

**Before (hardcoded):**
```
User: Create a html dashboard page that checks the connection to the ollama model
Tasks:
1. Quick analysis: Understand project and requirements (30 seconds max)
2. Design the solution architecture
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add supporting features
5. Test and refine
6. Update project documentation
```

**After (AI-powered):**
```
User: Create a html dashboard page that checks the connection to the ollama model
Tasks:
1. [HIGH] Analyze requirements: Create HTML dashboard with Ollama connection status
2. [HIGH] Create HTML structure with dashboard layout and status indicators
3. [HIGH] Implement JavaScript to check Ollama API connectivity at localhost:11434
4. [HIGH] Add CSS styling for dashboard appearance and status visualization
5. [MEDIUM] Implement auto-refresh functionality to periodically check connection
6. [MEDIUM] Add error handling and user-friendly status messages
7. [LOW] Test dashboard functionality and document usage
```

## Benefits

1. **Specific Tasks**: Tasks now directly address what the user asked for
2. **Intelligent Planning**: AI understands context and creates logical task sequences
3. **Better Priorities**: Tasks are prioritized based on dependencies and importance
4. **Technical Detail**: Task names include implementation specifics
5. **Dynamic**: Each request gets a custom task plan, not a generic template

## Testing

To see the improvement:
1. Make any multi-step request
2. Watch for "ðŸ¤” Analyzing request and planning tasks..." message
3. Tasks will be specific to your request, not generic templates
4. Each task will have appropriate technical details
