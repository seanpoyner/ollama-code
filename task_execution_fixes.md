# Task Execution Fixes for Ollama Code

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ESC Only Cancelling Individual Tasks
**Issue**: When pressing ESC during task execution, it was only cancelling the current task and marking it as complete, then moving to the next task instead of stopping the entire process.

**Solution**: Added proper cancellation handling in `_execute_tasks_sequentially()`:
- When a task is cancelled, now prompts user: "Stop all remaining tasks? [y/n]"
- If user chooses "yes", sets `cancelled_all = True` and breaks the task loop
- If user chooses "no", continues with the next task
- Shows appropriate status message when execution is stopped

### 2. AI Not Executing Tasks Properly
**Issue**: The AI was confused about the project context and wasn't actually implementing the tasks, just saying things weren't possible.

**Solution**: Enhanced task context in `thought_loop.py` to include:
- Instructions to read OLLAMA.md for project context
- Commands to use list_files() and bash('ls -la') to see existing files
- Explicit instruction: "Actually implement what the task asks for - don't just say it's not possible!"

## Changes Made

### ollama_code/core/agent.py

#### _execute_tasks_sequentially() method:
1. Added `cancelled_all` flag to track if user wants to stop all tasks
2. Check for "Request cancelled" in result
3. Prompt user to decide if they want to stop all tasks or continue
4. Show different completion messages based on how execution ended:
   - Normal completion: Shows all tasks completed
   - User cancellation: Shows how many tasks were completed/pending

### ollama_code/core/thought_loop.py

#### get_next_task_context() method:
Added critical instructions for confused AI:
```python
context += "CRITICAL: If you are confused about the project context or what files exist:\n"
context += "1. Use read_file() to read OLLAMA.md for project context\n"
context += "2. Use list_files() to see what files exist in the project\n"
context += "3. Use bash('ls -la') to see all files including hidden ones\n"
context += "4. Actually implement what the task asks for - don't just say it's not possible!"
```

## Expected Behavior Now

### ESC Cancellation:
1. Press ESC during task execution
2. Current task is cancelled
3. Prompted: "Stop all remaining tasks? [y/n]"
   - Choose "y": All task execution stops, shows summary
   - Choose "n": Continues with next task

### Task Execution:
1. AI will check project context before claiming something isn't possible
2. AI will read OLLAMA.md and list files to understand the project
3. AI will actually implement the requested functionality
4. AI won't just say "there's no backend" without checking first

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Run a multi-task request: `ollama-code -p "Create a backend API with authentication"`
2. Press ESC during task execution
3. Verify you're prompted to stop all tasks
4. Verify the AI actually creates files and implements features instead of just explaining why it can't
