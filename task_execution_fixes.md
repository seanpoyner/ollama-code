# Task Execution Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tasks Auto-Executing Without User Confirmation
**Problem:** When the agent created a task list, it would immediately start executing all tasks without waiting for user confirmation.

**Fix:** 
- Removed automatic call to `_execute_tasks_sequentially` after task creation
- Changed the flow to:
  1. User makes a request
  2. Agent creates task plan and shows todo list
  3. Control returns to user with message: "Tasks created! Use /tasks to start execution."
  4. User must explicitly run `/tasks` to begin execution

**Files Changed:**
- `ollama_code/core/agent.py` (lines 314-317)

### 2. "Implement first improvement" Task Not Working
**Problem:** Tasks created from templates had no context about what to actually implement. The AI would see "Implement first improvement" but have no idea what improvement was requested.

**Fix:**
- Added `original_request` storage in ThoughtLoop to preserve user's original request
- Modified task context to include both the original request and the specific task
- Now each task execution includes:
  - Original user request (e.g., "Do something to improve this project")
  - Current specific task (e.g., "Implement first improvement")

**Files Changed:**
- `ollama_code/core/thought_loop.py`:
  - Added `self.original_request` field (line 21)
  - Store request in `process_request` method (line 29)
  - Include original request in task context (lines 212-213)

### 3. Updated /tasks Command
**Problem:** The `/tasks` command only showed the todo list without actually executing tasks.

**Fix:**
- Modified `/tasks` to check for pending/in-progress tasks
- If tasks exist, it shows the todo list and starts execution
- If no tasks exist, it shows a helpful message

**Files Changed:**
- `ollama_code/main.py` (lines 205-218)

### 4. Updated Help Documentation
**Fix:** Updated help text to clarify the new task execution flow:
- Added `/todo` command documentation
- Updated `/tasks` description to clarify it executes pending tasks
- Added example showing task creation flow

**Files Changed:**
- `messages.json` (line 259)

## New Workflow

1. **User creates tasks:**
   ```
   User: Do something to improve this project that requires multiple steps
   ```

2. **Agent responds with task plan:**
   - Shows task breakdown
   - Displays todo list
   - Returns control with: "Tasks created! Use /tasks to start execution."

3. **User reviews and executes:**
   ```
   User: /tasks
   ```

4. **Agent executes tasks one by one:**
   - Each task includes context from original request
   - User can approve/deny file writes
   - Progress shown after each task
   - Todos cleared when all tasks complete

## Benefits

1. **User Control:** Users now have explicit control over when task execution begins
2. **Better Context:** Each task execution includes the original request context, so the AI knows what to implement
3. **Clear Workflow:** The separation between planning and execution is now explicit
4. **Flexibility:** Users can review, modify, or cancel tasks before execution begins
