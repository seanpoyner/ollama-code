## Fixed Issues
- ✅ ESC feature now prompts to stop all tasks or just current one
- ✅ File creation fix - AI now uses write_file() instead of showing code
- ✅ File exploration - AI reads complete files, not just 50 chars
- ✅ Task orchestration - Results passed between tasks
- ✅ Task validation - Ensures files are actually created
- ✅ Analysis truncation - Prevents syntax errors from long responses
- ✅ Task retry mechanism - Automatic retry with validation (max 3 attempts)
- ✅ Better error recovery - Specific retry guidance for different task types
- ✅ Documentation system - Web search, cache, and knowledge base to prevent hallucination
- ✅ Long-term memory - Learns from successful implementations
