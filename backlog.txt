## Fixed Issues
- ✅ ESC feature now prompts to stop all tasks or just current one
- ✅ File creation fix - AI now uses write_file() instead of showing code
- ✅ File exploration - AI reads complete files, not just 50 chars
- ✅ Task orchestration - Results passed between tasks
- ✅ Task validation - Ensures files are actually created
- ✅ Analysis truncation - Prevents syntax errors from long responses

## Remaining Issues
- implement mcp servers
- implement github integrations
- Add better error recovery when tasks fail
- Add task retry mechanism for failed tasks
