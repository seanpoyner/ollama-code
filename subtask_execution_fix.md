# Sub-task Execution Fix

## Problems Identified

1. **AI explaining instead of executing**: The AI was writing explanatory text about what it would do rather than executing code
2. **Syntax errors with write_file()**: The AI was trying to show `write_file()` calls inside larger code blocks, causing unterminated string errors
3. **No actual file creation**: Tasks marked complete without creating files
4. **Analysis tasks not executing**: The AI would describe exploration steps but not run them

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Sub-task Manager (NEW)

Created `subtask_manager.py` that breaks complex tasks into executable steps:

```python
class SubTaskType(Enum):
    EXPLORE = "explore"      # Read files, search codebase
    CREATE = "create"        # Create new files
    MODIFY = "modify"        # Modify existing files
    EXECUTE = "execute"      # Run commands
    TEST = "test"           # Run tests
```

Each sub-task contains:
- Type (explore/create/modify/execute/test)
- Description (what this step does)
- Code (exact code to execute)
- Expected output (optional)

### 2. Pre-defined Sub-tasks for Common Tasks

The SubTaskManager automatically creates appropriate sub-tasks:

**For Analysis Tasks:**
1. Read project context (OLLAMA.md)
2. Find relevant Python files
3. Search for API usage

**For Backend/Endpoint Tasks:**
1. Create backend service file with complete code

**For Test Tasks:**
1. Create test file with complete unit tests

**For Function Implementation:**
1. Create Python file with the function

### 3. Simplified Execution Context

Changed the task context to be more direct:
```
EXECUTION RULES:
1. EXECUTE CODE DIRECTLY - Do not explain what you would do
2. Use SEPARATE code blocks for each action
3. NEVER show write_file() inside explanatory text
4. Execute commands ONE AT A TIME
```

### 4. Sub-task Execution Flow

When a task has sub-tasks:
1. The AI receives ONLY the code to execute
2. No room for explanation or interpretation
3. Each sub-task completes before moving to the next
4. Main task only completes when all sub-tasks are done

### 5. Avoided Complex String Escaping

Instead of complex multi-line strings with escaping:
```python
# OLD (causes syntax errors)
write_file("file.py", """
complex
multi-line
content
""")

# NEW (simple and reliable)
content = '''import requests

def my_function():
    pass
'''
write_file('file.py', content)
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Task Planning**: AI creates high-level tasks
2. **Sub-task Creation**: Each task is broken into executable steps
3. **Sequential Execution**: AI executes one sub-task at a time
4. **No Explanation**: AI only sees the code to execute
5. **Validation**: Each step is validated before moving on

## Example Flow

Task: "Implement a function to fetch available models"

Sub-tasks created:
1. **Create ollama_models.py** with the complete function code
   - AI receives: `write_file("ollama_models.py", """[complete code]""")`
   - AI executes it directly

Task: "Analyze the ollama API"

Sub-tasks created:
1. **Read OLLAMA.md** - `content = read_file("OLLAMA.md"); print(content[:1000])`
2. **Find Python files** - `bash("find . -name '*.py' | head -20")`
3. **Search API usage** - `bash("grep -r 'localhost:11434' . --include='*.py'")`

## Benefits

1. **No syntax errors**: Simple, direct code execution
2. **Guaranteed execution**: AI can't explain instead of doing
3. **Step-by-step progress**: Each sub-task completes before the next
4. **Better validation**: Can check each step's output
5. **Clearer flow**: AI and user can see exactly what's happening

## Testing

The system should now:
- Execute exploration commands for analysis tasks
- Create actual files for implementation tasks
- Run tests when asked
- Complete tasks without syntax errors
- Show clear progress through sub-tasks
