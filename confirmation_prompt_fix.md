# Confirmation Prompt Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Threading Issue in Sandbox
**File:** `ollama_code/core/sandbox.py`

The main issue was that the confirmation callback was being called from within the `read_stdout` thread, which doesn't have access to the terminal for user input. 

**Solution implemented:**
1. Added a `queue.Queue()` to communicate between threads
2. When the stdout thread detects a confirmation request, it puts it in the queue
3. The main thread monitors the queue and handles the confirmation prompt
4. The response is written back to the confirmation file for the subprocess to read

**Code changes:**
- Added `confirmation_queue = queue.Queue()` 
- Modified `read_stdout` to put requests in the queue instead of calling the callback directly
- Added a monitoring loop in the main thread that checks the queue and handles confirmations

### 2. Added Logging for Debugging
**File:** `ollama_code/core/agent.py`

Added logging statements to track when confirmations are requested and what the user responds:
- `logger.info(f"Prompting user for file write confirmation: {filename}")`
- `logger.info(f"User choice for {filename}: {choice}")`
- Similar logging for bash command confirmations

## How It Works Now

1. **Python code execution starts** in a subprocess
2. **File write requested** - subprocess writes request to temp file and prints marker
3. **Thread detects marker** - puts request in queue for main thread
4. **Main thread gets request** - calls confirmation callback with terminal access
5. **User sees prompt** - can properly input y/n/a response
6. **Response written** - main thread writes response to temp file
7. **Subprocess continues** - reads response and proceeds accordingly

## Benefits

1. **Proper terminal access** - Prompts now run in the main thread with full terminal access
2. **No more hanging** - User input is properly captured and processed
3. **Thread safety** - Clean separation between monitoring and user interaction
4. **Better debugging** - Logging helps track the confirmation flow

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Ask the AI to create a file: "Create a README.md file"
2. The confirmation prompt should appear and wait for input
3. Try y/n/a options - all should work properly
4. Test bash commands similarly
